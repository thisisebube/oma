      My sweetest bby 💕,<br><br>

      Every time I think about how we met and how you've become my everything, my heart does that funny little compile-fast thing only you can trigger.<br><br>

      You've seen me at my buggiest—late nights, stressed commits, coffee-fueled chaos—and still choose to stay, to laugh with me, to hold my hand through it all.<br><br>

      You make ordinary days feel like magic updates. Your smile is my favorite debug tool, your voice my best notification sound, and your love the only feature I never want to refactor.<br><br>

      Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, but honestly, every single day since you came into my life already feels like the most beautiful celebration.<br><br>

      So with every beat of this heart that's all yours,<br>
      will you officially be my Valentine? ❤️<br><br>

      I love you more than words (or code) can ever express,<br>
      Your forever guy,<br>
      Okoroafor Ebubechukwu Covenant 💘
